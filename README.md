# Nutrition App

This is a nutrition tracking project that logs nutrient intake. The client is written using Typescript with React and the server is written using Typescript with Node.js and Express. The goal of this app is to help users to easily track and log their nutrient intake. Users can search for food items and add them to their daily log. Signing up for a account will allow users to track and monitor multiple logs and even sort them by calory consumption.

## Get Started

Inside the server directory, `npm install` will install all dependant packages to start the applicaiton. `npm run devstart` will then start the development server. Server will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
